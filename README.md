# Udacity training repos

This repository is the container for my personal training code which I've written due to the Udacity lessons.
To keep things organized I've created for each practical coding challenge a seperate submodule.


## Clone and initialize the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ifahrentholz/udacity && cd udacity && git submodule update --init --recursive
```
